# olfaction
A probabilistic approach to demixing odors

To generate all figures from the paper, run a_main.m script in matlab.

The simulation takes about a day, figures are stored silently in the figures/ folder created in the main directory (directory from which MATLAB is running). Other parameters useful for re-running the simulation are stored in mats/ folder. To run with a new parameter setting, this folder must be removed and the parameter pnet.randomseed from L5 in initModelParameters.m needs to be changed.
